The projects in this directory are the link list. The project tries to emphasise the need of knowledge to insert, delete,and traverse through list Items
The tasks on the projec are as follows:
#Task 0:
Write the function that print the elements of a list.

#Task 1:
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

Prototype: size_t list_len(const list_t *h);

#task 2:
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup

#task 3:

Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup

#task 4:

Write a function that frees a list_t list.

Prototype: void free_list(list_t *head);

#task 5:


Write a function that frees a list_t list.

Prototype: void free_list(list_t *head);

##OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECTT
The objective of the project was to enable us learn:

When and why using linked lists vs arrays
How to build and use linked lists
Print list
List length -Loop through the list and printot the elements

Add node
Add node at the end
